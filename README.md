## Technical details on history

The Discord Bot (apps/bot) was built on top of [CarelessDev/harunon.js](https://github.com/CarelessDev/harunon.js)

Shikimori-san and later are in this repository.

Yukinoshita Haruno were in [CarelessDev/harunon.js](https://github.com/CarelessDev/harunon.js)
for new JavaScript version and [CarelessDev/Harunon](https://github.com/CarelessDev/Harunon)
for old Python version.

The first ever Waifu Bot, or said first useful discord bot in our server is at [CarelessDev/SIMP-Bot](https://github.com/CarelessDev/SIMP-Bot)

### Version History

**Version 1** -> Python Skittle-chan Era  
**Version 2** -> Python Harunon Era  
**Version 3** -> JavaScript  
**Version 4** -> Full Stack Waifu with Turborepo

_Version 4.1_ -> Removed full stack website (because it is broken and lazy to fix)

**Version 5** -> Few breaking changes

- Cocoa Discord ~~Utils~~ v3
- Major changes to some feature, see changelog

**Version 6** -> Brought back website with better stack

- No more graphql with separate NestJS backend to reduce overhead. It is too overkill and suck.
- also Next.js
  > Why I don't use Next.js: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM0njSK-bPg&t=338s
- still use Prisma, cannot move away to other 😭
